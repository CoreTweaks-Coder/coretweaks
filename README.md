## 🛡️ Antivirus False Positives
Because Core Tweaks uses frameworks to access low-level system settings, some AV engines (like Trapmine or Gridinsoft) may flag it.

- **Flag:** `Trojan.Heur!.02016023` (This is a heuristic flag, meaning the AV doesn't recognize the app and is suspicious of its optimization behavior).
- **Flag:** `Malicious.moderate.ml.score` (This is an AI-generated score because the app is unsigned).

**Is it safe?**
Yes. The Code IS going to be uploaded in some time {when the first release is released}
